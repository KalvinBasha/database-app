# database-app

This assignment was going well on the Friday so I had high hopes for it. I had no time to work on it Saturday, but continued on it Sunday until I got stuck on a bit with the client. Revisited it today and I just can't get past it and move on. Whatever the solution may be I know it's in the resources you provide, whether it's in the recordings, moodle, or github but I just can't figure it out. 
It is disappointing because I think I did very well last assignment and was making progress on full stack tasks involving server and client ever since we did the group work but I think this definitely shows my knowledge isn't where I thought it was and I need to go over it again and learn more.
Apologies for the lack of a sumbission, just hasn't been very successful for me in the later part of last week. I will try to fix and improve this over this week and possibly get help with explaining last week's assignment if possible.
